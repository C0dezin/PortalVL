1. **Select a Language**:  
   Choose the language for your voice lines.  

2. **Provide the Source Unpack Folder**:  
   Enter the path to your *Source Unpack* folder. **Do not use the `source unpack/portal` folder**; only the main *Source Unpack* directory is required.  

3. **Minimal Voice Line Preset (Optional)**:  
   The tool will ask if you want the *minimal voice line preset* (created by XnonXte).  
   - If you accept, only essential voice lines with callouts (e.g., a "ShutUpGLaDOS" mode) will be included.  

4. **Wait for Completion**:  
   After selecting your options, press Enter and wait for the process to finish.
